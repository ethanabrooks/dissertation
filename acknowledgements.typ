= Acknowledgements
I am deeply grateful for the many individuals and institutions that have
supported me on my journey through the doctoral program and ultimately made this
dissertation possible.

*Toyota Research Institute*
My initial steps into the world of reinforcement learning research were funded
by the Toyota Research Institute. While their grant did not directly support the
work presented here, their early investment provided me with invaluable
resources and opportunities to explore the field and lay the groundwork for my
future research.

*Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)*
The DARPA L2M grant marked a pivotal moment in my development as a researcher.
This funding enabled me to produce my first research paper and provided
formative experience in the practical work of training deep RL agents and
producing scientific knowledge. Moreover, the ideas explored during this project
laid the foundation for my later work on generalization, which forms a
significant component of this dissertation.

*DeepMind*
My internship at DeepMind was a transformative experience. Not only did I
develop the core components of Chapter 2 within this intellectually vibrant
setting, but I also had the opportunity to savor a culture of scientific
excellence and innovation that is unparalleled in my experience. The endless
stream of mind-bending conversations with my brilliant colleagues planted seeds
of ideas that continue to grow and blossom. I would like to especially call out
the incredible support and mentorship of my manager Vlad Mnih, and my colleagues
Misha Laskin, Sebastian Flennerhag, and Alex Neitz.

*My Labmates, My Intellectual and Emotional Pillars:*
No journey of this magnitude can be undertaken alone. I owe an immense debt of
gratitude to my lab-mates, especially Chris Grimm, Zeyu Zhang, and Risto Vuori.
Their unwavering intellectual and emotional support throughout my PhD journey
has been immeasurable. From enduring countless pitches of hair-brained ideas and
providing insightful feedback to fanning the flames of hope during the
inevitable setbacks of research, they have consistently supported and often
challenged me to push my boundaries, making this journey not only more rewarding
but also far more fun.

*My Advisors and my Committee Members*
Finally, I express my deepest gratitude to my advisors, Professor Satinder Singh
and Professor Rick Lewis, and to the rest of my Committee. First, I am honored
by and thankful for the time and feedback of my committee members, Professor
Honglak Lee, Professor Rada Mihalcea, and Professor Thad Polk. I am also so
grateful for the first-class scientific education that I received from Rick
Lewis, who has been a constant sounding board throughout my research journey,
subjecting my ideas and my writing to meticulous examination and providing
invaluable critiques. His unwavering support, particularly in the final stretch
of my dissertation, has been truly indispensible.

To Satinder, I owe a profound debt of gratitude. At times, he "imparted truth
and health in rough electric shocks." But I came to recognize that what at first
could seem like inflexibility arose from an unwavering dedication to
intellectual and scientific excellence. I am incredibly fortunate to have
benefited from his uncompromising critical lens these past six years, a lens
which saved me months of frustration by steering me away from many a dead-end
project. He challenged me to meet intellectual standards that truly felt out of
reach at the start of this journey, and for that he has my lifelong gratitude.

To each and every one of you, my heartfelt thanks. Your support and guidance
have shaped me not only as a researcher but also as a person.
