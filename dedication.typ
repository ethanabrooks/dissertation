= Dedication

I dedicate this thesis to my beloved family, who supported me emotionally,
editorially, and culinarily throughout this work. When I needed wisdom, you gave
it. When I needed comfort, you gave it. When I needed solitude, you gave it.
When I needed caffeine, you gave it. I can never repay the debt, but you have my
endless love and gratitude.
